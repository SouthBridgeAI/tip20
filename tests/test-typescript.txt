To remove leading whitespace from a string in Node.js with TypeScript, you can use the `trimStart()` method. Here's a simple example:

```typescript
const stringWithLeadingWhitespace: string = "   Hello, world!";
const trimmedString: string = stringWithLeadingWhitespace.trimStart();

console.log(trimmedString); // Output: "Hello, world!"
```

The `trimStart()` method removes whitespace from the beginning of a string, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks. It returns a new string without modifying the original.

Alternatively, you can use the `trimLeft()` method, which is an alias for `trimStart()`:

```typescript
const trimmedString: string = stringWithLeadingWhitespace.trimLeft();
```

Both methods work the same way and are supported in modern versions of Node.js and TypeScript.

Would you like me to explain more about string manipulation in TypeScript or show you how to use this in a larger context?
